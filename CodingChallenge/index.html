            <p>Ranking of Kings is an anime that just finished airing last season and it surprisingly became one of my fav shows of all time. MC is deaf and mute and does his best he's great. Art style seems like it has some disney inspiration which some people were put off by for some reason but i loved it. Animation was abolutley top tier and i cant tell you how much i love this show without spoiling it so please just WATCH THIS SHOW thank you for comming to my ted talk</p>
